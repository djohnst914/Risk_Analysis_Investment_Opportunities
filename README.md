# Risk Analysis Evaluation - Four Fund Portfolios 

Here at your local FinTech investing platform, our goal is to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. To keep the costs low, our firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options. With my role as a quantitative analyst, I have been tasked with evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. In the main program app (risk_return_analysis_ipynb), I have successfully determined the fund with the most investment potential based on these key risk-management metrics: daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas. Please, take a look, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out to my personal email under the contributor section.

**First things first:**
If you don't have jupyter lab or python installed..
- **[Install and run JupyterLab:](https://jupyter.org/install)**

- **Now to clone this repository so you can open it up in JupyterLab:**
- **1:** Copy URL of this repo <img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 6 05 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/230800575-a264c086-dc62-42c5-a833-f7e4677ca4e0.png">
- **2:** Create a folder where you will clone this repo. As an example I created a folder 'Risk_Analysis' on my desktop <img width="40" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 6 07 15 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/230800621-6e4d5620-5118-42ea-9489-3c57e60cf693.png">
- **3:** Clone the repo into the newly created folder using the copied URL of the repo in the terminal using 'git clone' ![Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 6 09 52 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/230800715-d5186f8c-3feb-4a70-ad54-ccb00c88e10d.png)
- **4:** Make sure you are in the directory where you cloned the repo, then type jupyter-lab in the terminal and hit enter ![Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 6 10 57 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/230800741-191e49c0-acd7-4bf5-87dc-956dd2eac915.png)
- **5:** It make take a sec or two for the JupyterLab server to open, but once it does you should have something that looks like this <img width="1000" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 6 13 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/230800939-d49f3b2c-1ceb-44eb-ba5a-a2d9aac01d40.png">
**Note:** Once you have JupyterLab running, your terminal will look like this and you won't be able to use it. Don't delete it, if you want to use the terminal you can open another new window. The JupyterLab terminal you shouldn't delete will look something like this: ![Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 30 35 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382566-9c3cc3a8-b256-4481-bb1d-4d2c4c773026.png)
